# Writing script in R to reproduce this figure
The R script in this directory is a work in progress to fully reproduce the figure 2B from the Kruth et al. paper. 

## Tasks completed in this script to date

- Loading libraries for RStudio
- Uploading xslx file
- Modifying xslx file to express p-values as -log10(p-value)
- Making initial volcano plot using ggplot2
- Changed y-axis limits and label
- Added colors for sensitizing (green) vs. protective (purple) vs. non-significant (gray) genes
- Edited figure legend placement
- Edited plot background

## Tasks remaining

- Attempt to adjust label placement for MBNL1, PIK3CD, BRD4, and NR3C1 (GR) on the figure

## Tasks which were likely done using Illustrator rather than RStudio

- Changing the x-axis to an arrow rather than simple label
